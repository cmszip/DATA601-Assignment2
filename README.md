To be completed

## Motivation

Fall is a season of change and transition. But one thing never seems to change: people will talk about the weather. Conversation and jokes abound about the supposed craziness of the weather and temperature changes.

However, we rarely stop and take a moment to wonder if the weather is actually odd or if it's typical for the given time of year.

## Goal

Given the above motivation, the goal of this project is to determine if the forecasted temperatures are in line with historical data. If so, it will explain how the forecasted data falls within historical norms. If not, it will explain how the forecasted temperatures differ from historical norms. This project will use the 8 day forecast provided by OpenWeather API and compare it to the historical temperatures taken from a US Weather Station for the same area over those same days. 

Using API and historical data to compare Baltimore forecast to historical temperatures for those same days.
